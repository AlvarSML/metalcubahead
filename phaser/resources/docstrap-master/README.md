# Tomorrow

A modified [DocStrap](https://github.com/docstrap/docstrap) template for [JSDoc3](http://usejsdoc.org/).

## Command Line Example

```bash
jsdoc -c path/to/conf.json -t ./node_modules/ink-docstrap/template -R README.md -r .
```

- The `-c` sets the config, and the docstrap README does talk about the options you can put in templates that docstrap is supposed to look for.
- The `-t` sets the template. This is the option you need to set to get the docstrap template to be used.
- The `-R` sets a markdown file to be the front page of the documentation.
- The `-r` tells jsdoc to run recursively.
- The `.` says from current directory.

## Configuring the template

A [JSDoc configuration file](http://usejsdoc.org/about-configuring-jsdoc.html) with some [extra options](https://github.com/docstrap/docstrap#configuring-the-template).

Likely defaults:

```json
{
	"opts": {
		"debug"                 : false,
	},
	"templates": {
		"analytics"             : {
			"ua"                  : "",
			"domain"              : ""
		},
		"collapseSymbols"       : false,
		"copyright"             : "",
		"dateFormat"            : "",
		"footer"                : "",
		"includeDate"           : true,
		"inverseNav"            : false,
		"linenums"              : false,
		"navType"               : "vertical",
		"outputSourceFiles"     : true,
		"outputSourcePath"      : true,
		"search"                : false,
		"sort"                  : null,
		"systemName"            : "Documentation",
		"theme"                 : "phaser"
	}
}
```
